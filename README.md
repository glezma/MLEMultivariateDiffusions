# Likelihood Expansions For Multivariate Diffusions
Implementation of Yacine A√èT-SAHALIA algorithm for obtaining closed form likelihood expansions for multivariate diffusion processes: https://www.princeton.edu/~yacine/multivarmle.pdf
* This Mathematica code obtains the closed form likelihood expansion for any multivariate diffucion process. 
The base notebook file contains an example using a bivariate Heston Process.
